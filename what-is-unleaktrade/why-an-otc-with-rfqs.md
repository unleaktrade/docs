# Why an OTC with RFQs?

Traditional OTC trading, especially for large or bespoke trades, often happens off-chain through brokers, chat, or private networks.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
These processes suffer from:

* lack of transparency,
* inconsistent competitive pressure,
* operational risk,
* and limited on-chain settlement guarantees.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
An RFQ system solves these problems by:

* allowing **multiple takers to compete** without leaking price intentions early,
* enforcing **time-bounded commitments and reveals**, reducing strategic manipulation,
* guaranteeing that **every RFQ ends in a clear outcome**, either trade or exit,
* and embedding **economic incentives** that align participants with honest behavior.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This approach democratises OTC price discovery for all participants while preserving confidentiality and enforceability on-chain.
{% endhint %}

UnleakTrade makes RFQs practical on Solana by integrating them with secure smart-contract logic and token escrows that enforce commitments without manual intermediaries.
