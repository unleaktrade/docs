# Quick Start

{% hint style="warning" %}
Work In Progress
{% endhint %}

This section is designed to help you understand UnleakTrade quickly, without reading the full documentation.

It introduces the core mental model, the RFQ flow, and the key ideas you need before diving into details or using the protocol.

You don’t need to know how the protocol is implemented, only how it behaves.

---

## Who This Is For

Quick Start is useful if you are:

- discovering UnleakTrade for the first time,
- trying to understand RFQs conceptually,
- deciding whether the protocol fits your use case,
- or preparing to use RFQs as a maker or a taker.

If you want deep technical details, you can skip ahead — but most readers should start here.

## How to Read This Section

This section is intentionally short and progressive:

1. **Mental Model**  
   Explains how to *think* about UnleakTrade: commitments, deadlines, and guarantees.

2. **RFQ in 1 Minute**  
   Walks through a complete RFQ flow, end to end, in plain language.

After that, you can move confidently into the full RFQ lifecycle and state documentation.

## What You Will Get Out of It

By the end of Quick Start, you should:

- understand what problem RFQs solve,
- know what happens during an RFQ,
- and feel comfortable navigating the rest of the documentation.

This section is about clarity, not completeness.

---

## Where to Go Next

- Start with **Mental Model** to build intuition.
- Then read **RFQ in 1 Minute** to see the flow in action.
- Finally, move on to **RFQ States** for the full breakdown.

Quick Start is the shortest path from *“What is this?”* to *“I get it.”*
