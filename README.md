# What is UnleakTrade?

{% hint style="info" %}
UnleakTrade is a decentralized RFQ-based trading protocol that brings **institutional-grade price discovery and secure over-the-counter (OTC) trading on Solana**.
{% endhint %}

Instead of traditional OTC markets - which are opaque, manual, and dominated by intermediaries - UnleakTrade enables:

* **competitive blind quoting**, where multiple takers compete without exposing prices,
* **cryptographic commit–reveal guarantees**, preserving confidentiality,
* **structured settlement flows** that ensure predictable outcomes.

On UnleakTrade, a maker publishes a request for quote (RFQ), takers submit commitments, then reveals, and finally a selected counterparty completes settlement. This flow improves price competitiveness and fairness while preserving privacy and enforcing honest participation.

UnleakTrade leverages Solana’s performance and emerging privacy-centric techniques to make off-market trading both secure and efficient.
